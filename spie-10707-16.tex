\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
As part of the LSST Science Platform, we are developing a JupyterLab-based environment to enable free-form interactive data analysis that integrates with other parts of the LSST Science Platform such as Data Access APIs and the Science User Interface.
This container-based architecture, deployed on top of Kubernetes, will allow users to interact with LSST data products and services using python code.
It is also intended as an internal tool to allow the LSST Commissioning Team to perform verification of the LSST system prior to the release of this platform to the general scientific community.
We will discuss the considerable opportunities (as well as some of the potential pitfalls) of using Jupyter notebooks as a programmatic interface to the LSST Data Facility capabilities.
